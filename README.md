<h2>Executive Summary</h2>


<div >
 
 
 

<p>This live radio app allows clients the options to easily create and maintain their own live radio feed and/or to subscribe and tune into their favourite stations. As the popularity of podcasts and radio shows continue to grow, this has become a convenient place where users go to gain knowledge and grow. We are creating a space to continue touch points between businesses and their audiences. In a world overloaded with short-form content [ tweets, videos , news articles, etc ] we provide opportunity to showcase individual expertise in a way other formats don’t accommodate. </p>

Our app features : live radio over the internet, radio broadcast feeds specific to locations that users can queue music to,  ability to save live recordings, sharing playlists across multiple music platforms and redefining radio by allowing video and photos. 
 Similar to “Spotify” podcasts  and “iHeartRadio”, this platform offers enormous opportunity to expand information being provided to the clients audience while also being able to support co-platform supporters. Our app puts special focus on  being the host of your own show and working to build loyal (long-term) personal connections and trust between client and audience. We put the client as an authority of their industry. With full accountability for live feed content, clients are able to create ad driven placements that would allow them to negotiate B2B Advertising Marketing. This application can go a long way towards a client growing their brand and increasing the size/value of their network. 

<h2>User Types </h2>

<p>Broadcasters, content creators, Administrators - These users curate and host live feed.
Listeners, consumers -   These users tune in and listen to live feed, and queue up songs to communal playlists. </p>
